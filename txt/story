The king has died without an heir leaving the throne contested. The realm has
descended into chaos as the Lords and Ladies of noble houses are fighting for
power.

You are the head of a small but ancient noble house without much wealth or
influence to speak of. You start your journey with a small estate including
a modest house, little gold and a few servants.

Ancient blood of old kings flows in your veins though, and it is not content
with such a meager status for a house which long ago ruled these lands. Your
task is to subdue the other noble houses and claim the throne.
